## Project Overview
The Binary Trees Project is an implementation of various operations and data structures related to binary trees, a fundamental concept in computer science. Through this project, we will build, traverse, manipulate, and analyze binary tree structures using C.

### Description
This project includes tasks that demonstrate:
- Understanding and implementation of binary tree structures.
- Traversal techniques (pre-order, in-order, post-order).
- Insertion, deletion, and analysis of binary trees.
- Practical applications and enhancements of binary trees, including Binary Search Trees (BSTs), AVL Trees, and Max Heaps.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Deepen knowledge of binary tree data structures.
- Explore their traversal and manipulation techniques.
- Analyze their properties and behaviors (e.g., height, depth, balance).
- Develop optimized and modular C code following the Betty style guide.

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Explain what a binary tree is.
- Differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Discuss the time complexity benefits of binary trees compared to linked lists.
- Understand the concepts of depth, height, size, and traversal methods.
- Identify complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

---

## Requirements
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- **Compilation**: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using GCC with the following flags:
- gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

- **Coding Style**: Code must adhere to the Betty style guidelines.
- **Global Variables**: Not allowed.
- **Maximum Functions per File**: 5.
- **Header Files**: All prototypes must be included in `binary_trees.h` and include guards must be used.

## Tasks
### Mandatory
1. **New Node**: Create a binary tree node.
2. **Insert Left**: Insert a node as the left child.
3. **Insert Right**: Insert a node as the right child.
4. **Delete**: Delete an entire binary tree.
5. **Is Leaf**: Check if a node is a leaf.
6. **Is Root**: Check if a node is the root.
7. **Pre-order Traversal**: Traverse a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
8. **In-order Traversal**: Traverse a binary tree using in-order traversal.
9. **Post-order Traversal**: Traverse a binary tree using post-order traversal.
10. **Height**: Measure the height of a binary tree.
11. **Depth**: Measure the depth of a node.
12. **Size**: Measure the size of a binary tree.
13. **Leaves**: Count the number of leaves.
14. **Nodes**: Count the nodes with at least one child.
15. **Balance Factor**: Measure the balance factor.
16. **Is Full**: Check if the binary tree is full.
17. **Is Perfect**: Check if the binary tree is perfect.
18. **Sibling**: Find the sibling of a node.
19. **Uncle**: Find the uncle of a node.
